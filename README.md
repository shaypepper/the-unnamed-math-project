# The unnamed math project

While I'm job hunting, I wanted to include _some_ of the code I write in my free time. I really enjoy a certain math [project](http://projecteuler.com), and all problems here come from that site. This is a small sample of my solutions for the project. 

I'm intentionally not using the name of the project in this folder so that it won't show up in any searches. I am sharing as a code sample and not to give answers away.

If you use the algorithms in this folder for your own account, the math gods will certainly smite you. :)
